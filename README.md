# MARKDOWN TO HTML
## CONVERT MULTIPLE MARKDOWN FILES TO HTML - AS ZIP
```sh
The application converts all markdown files to HTML and gives you the option
to save a new zip archive with already converted files.  

Using the checkbox at the bottom of the page, you can include other (non-.md) files in
the conversion result; if the checkbox is deactivated, other (non-.md) files
will not be included in the result.  
Be sure to specify your choice before starting the conversion
```
